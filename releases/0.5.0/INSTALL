Prerequisites
=============
In order to install this package, you must have the following already
set up on your system:
 - Python (tested on 2.6 and 3.1)
 - GNU Make

In order to use this software you also need:
 - RegLookup (version 1.0.0 or later)

Earlier versions of Python may work, but they have not yet been tested.

To obtain RegLookup, please see the project page at:
  http://www.sentinelchicken.org/projects/reglookup/

You do not need to have RegLookup installed before installing this
software, but you will need to have it installed and in your PATH
whenever you run grokevt-builddb(1).


Building
========

For most installations, this is as simple as:

 make

which will create the build/ directory with all install-ready items
neatly arranged.  (If your system does not use GNU Make by default,
you'll probably have to use `gmake' instead.)  If you wish to change
the path of the configuration files, you will want to instead set the
ETC_PREFIX variable:

 make ETC_PREFIX=/path/to/etc

This path defaults to '/usr/local/etc'.


Installing
==========
Installation is typically as simple as:

 make install

If you wish to override any of the installation prefixes (please see the
top-level make file for all available paths), you'll need to specify
those on the command line as well.  By default, everything installs
somewhere under '/usr/local'.  If you wanted to change this to '/usr',
you could do:

  make PREFIX=/usr install

If you just want to override the ETC_PREFIX, you need to override it
during build *and* during install.
