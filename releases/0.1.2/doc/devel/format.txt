Windows Event Log Entry Format.

0: 32bits, little endian
   Length of record, in bytes, including these 4 bytes

1: 32bits, fixed value
   Message Separator, with value:
   1001100011001100100110001100101b or 0x4c664c65 or "LfLe"

2: 32bits, little endian
   Message Number

3: 32bits, little endian
   Date Created UTC, in seconds since the epoch(unix?).  

4: 32bits, little endian
   Date Written UTC, in seconds since the epoch(unix?).

5: 32bits, little endian
   Event ID and Offset
   High two bytes are the offset into the windoze DLL which holds the
   messages.  The two low order bytes are what is displayed to the user
   as the Event ID.  The number taken as a whole is used to grab the
   message from the DLL using the windoze FormatMessage() call.

6: 16bits, little endian
   Event Type
   One of 5 values.

7: 16bits, little endian
   String Count 
   The number of strings in the event? Not always accurate?

8: 16bits, little endian
   Category

9: 16bits
   UNKNOWN

10: 32bits
    UNKNOWN

11: 32bits, little endian
    Strings Offset
    Pointer to a sequence of NULL terminated unicode strings
    (NULL == '\x00\x00') used in the message template.  
    This pointer is relative to the very beginning of the record.
    The end of the strings section appears to be the beginning of the
    other data section.

12: 32bits, little endian
    SID string length
    Set to 0 if it isn't included.

13: 32bits, little endian
    SID pointer
    This pointer is relative to the very beginning of the record.

14: 32bits, little endian
    Other data length
    Length of supplimentary data included in log.  
    0 if none exists.

15: 32bits, little endian
    Other data pointer
    This pointer is relative to the very beginning of the record.

16: variable length fields
    16.1: NULL terminated unicode string (NULL == '\x00\x00')
          The windoze log source.  This value is used to look up (using
          the registry) what DLLs need to be searched for the proper
          EventID message template.  

    16.2: NULL terminated unicode string (NULL == '\x00\x00')
          Computer Name which generated the log entry.

    16.3: General buffer.  Everything 12.2 is pointed to by the
          pointers in fields 11, 13, and 15.
