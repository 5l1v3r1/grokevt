GrokEVT


=NAME=
	GrokEVT - a collection of scripts built for reading windows
	event log files.


=DESCRIPTION=
	
=USING=
	Using GrokEVT on a set of windows partitions is a three stage
	process.  One must first mount the partitions and configure the
	system's profile.  Next, grokevt-builddb(1) must be run to
	extract the necessary information from these partitions.
	Finally, grokevt-parselog(1) may be run to use this information
	to convert the logs to something useful.
	
	**Mounting and Configuration**
	This is the most labor-intensive step of the process.  There are
	several technical reasons why this can't be simpler, and it is
	unlikely many will be resolved anytime soon. (Sorry, blame the
	vendor who produced these logs that you wish to convert.)
	
	First mount the partitions used by your windows system.
	Specifically, mount any partition that has software installed on
	it.  (You can probably get away with not mounting ones with no
	software, or no software that produces events in the event log.)
	This includes windows shares, if you have any with software
	installed on them.
	
	The key point when mounting partitions or shares, is that you
	must mount them with case-insensitive filenames.  To do this in
	Linux, you should be able to use the NTFS option 'posix=0', or
	with type vfat, 'posix' should do.  On FreeBSD, it appears one
	can use the -i option with NTFS and mount_ntfs, but this hasn't
	been tested.  (More research is necessary in this area.  Please
	let me know if case-insensitivity is available on other *NIXes
	and what the options are.)  All of this of course depends on
	your version of mount and related software.  See mount(8) for
	more information.

	Once you have all necessary filesystems mounted for your windows
	image, you need to configure GrokEVT so it knows where
	everything is.
