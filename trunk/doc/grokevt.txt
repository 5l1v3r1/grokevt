GrokEVT


=NAME=
	GrokEVT - a collection of scripts built for reading windows
	event log files.


=DESCRIPTION=
	
=USING=
	Using GrokEVT on a set of windows partitions is a three stage
	process.  One must first mount the partitions and configure the
	system's profile.  Next, grokevt-builddb(1) must be run to
	extract the necessary information from these partitions.
	Finally, grokevt-parselog(1) may be run to use this information
	to convert the logs to something useful.
