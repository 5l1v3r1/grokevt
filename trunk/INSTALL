Building
========

For most installations, this is as simple as:

 make

which will create the build/ directory with all install-ready items
neatly arranged.  If you desire to change the path of the configuration
files, you will want to instead set the ETC_PREFIX variable:

 make ETC_PREFIX=/path/to/etc

This path defaults to '/usr/local/etc'.


Installing
==========
Installation is typically as simple as:

 make install

If you wish to override any of the installation prefixes (please see the
top-level make file for all available paths), you'll need to specify
those on the command line as well.  By default, everything installs
somewhere under '/usr/local'.  If you wanted to change this to '/usr',
you could do:

  make PREFIX=/usr install

If you just want to override the ETC_PREFIX, you need to override it
during build *and* during install.  (Sorry, this will be fixed at some
point.)
